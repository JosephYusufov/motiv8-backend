Have you ever wondered what other Instagram users think when they’re looking at your profile? 
As many users start to use Instagram, it is more challenging to stand out from the crowd. Hence, the first impression of your feed will determine whether or not your potential audience is going to follow you and engage with your content. Most of the time, influencers overlook managing their feed as a whole, and rather focus on individual posts. While making sure each post looks great is vital, it is also important to ensure that the collection of all your posts will still appeal to your audience. Here are a few simple tricks that help me manage my Instagram feed.

## 1. Choose a theme that resonates with you

Theming plays a big role in attracting audiences for your content. In fact, this is the most common technique to ensure you have a visually pleasing feed. There are many ways to implement recurring themes for your feed ranging from choosing the same color palette to keeping the background of your photos the same. These steps will have a massive impact on your feed. There are various popular themes for you to start with: dark, bright, and colorful. Personally, I love to have a colorful theme that is clear and detailed. Keeping the same theme throughout your feed might be tricky, however this necessary step makes sure that your posts will not clash with each other.

## 2. Edit your Posts

In order to support your theme, you also need to edit the photo so that it fits the style of your theme. In the above comparison, the left photo is unedited, and the right photo has been touched up. In order to support your theme, you also need to edit the photo that fits your theme style. Editing your Instagram post helps enhance the existing colors in your photos, and your editing style can also become your own signature. A few of the editing techniques that you can use are sharpening the little details, emphasizing shadows to create depth in your pictures, and focusing on certain elements of your post. There are many ways to edit your post, however I like to use the same filters on each of my photos where I try to surface all little details on my post to be visually appealing. If you don’t have much experience editing photos, there are many intuitive editing apps out there such as [Snapseed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapseed/id439438619), [Lightroom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom-photo-editor/id878783582) and [Quickshot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/enlight-quickshot-edit-photos/id1254875992) which come with their own presets and filters.

## 3. Choose Your "Honey Post"

Your feed will not look appealing without the right content. Posting a “honey post” will help catch the attention of your audience. But what is a honey post? It is the pattern-interrupting post which can steal your audiences’ attention and trigger their emotions. To give an example, a honey post can be your pet, aesthetically pleasing food, or a hard-hitting quote. The idea here is to find your own niche, ie: what you love to share.

A good honey post can combine a few of these “honey elements”, but keeping your usage of these elements to 1-3 per post will help to organize the content in your feed better, and will introduce consistency and originality throughout your feed. 

These are a few tricks that you can implement right now to improve your feed. Afterall, Instagram is the place where you can express yourself with your own specific style and there are no universal rules on what “Nice” should look like.
