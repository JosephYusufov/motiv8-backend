Hello readers, I am Richard Busato. It is my pleasure to meet you here.

Maybe some of you know me on Instagram, where I’m used to sharing lessons, experiences and projects with more than **20,000** people. Perhaps some of you don’t know me yet. I am a Web and iOS App developer, and I'm also entering the world of Design.

I have a question for you: *Can you build a website?* Maybe yes, maybe no. Either way, you should know the following **7 steps**. They’re essential because it's *not enough to know how to code*. If your goal is to build an incredible website, these next tips will help you. See you there!

## Step 1: You have to define your project

This step requires many questions. 
*What’s the main goal of the site?* 
*What’s the main audience?*
You should ask yourself: *What is the typical user that will visit my website?*
The key is to ask yourself many questions, because if you do, you get a lot of answers.
**Many Answers  =  Knowing exactly what to build.**

## Step 2: Plan out everything

Think about how to create a web page around the content, not about how to fill a web page with some content. Before drawing, you need to plan the elements of your site (images, text, videos, icons etc.) Which images do you want to use? This is called the **content-first** approach.

You have to define the navigation. We call this User Experience. *What's the first thing the user has to see? What steps should the user have to take?* If your website is confusing, the user may decide to exit. Make it Simple and Easy.

## Step 3: Before you design, sketch out your idea

Many times I’ve started building out a website without a draft. This approach is problematic, because you have to think about both code and design at the same time. It’s so difficult to do! **Never start coding without having an idea of what to build.**

You *don't* have to make difficult drawings.

You *don't* have to waste too much time.

You *don’t* have to think about the details.

Just find a few guiding design principles for your site, and write/sketch them out.

## Step 4: Design and develop your website

After the Sketch step, you have to design your website using HTML and CSS (or sass). This approach, where you design as you develop, is called **designing in the browser**. Then you can add all the JavaScript you want.

After creating your website, you need to make it **responsive**. More than **60% of people** browse the internet with smartphones. The smartphone’s screen is different from the laptop’s screen, so have to make your website responsive.

## Step 5: Optimize

**Optimization** is very important. Your websites’ performance is crucial, so when a website loads slowly, many users exit and choose another website. Any site would also benefit from some basic **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO). Google prefers optimized websites, and if your goal is to drive traffic to your website, being towards the top of the search results for certain keywords is crucial. Check out [this quick guide to SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo).

## Step 6: Deploy
You'll need a **Web Hosting Service** that hosts your website. (I’m not paid to say this, but I like [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.com/), it’s been excellent in my expereince). Some hosting services are better than others, but one important consideration is that a hosting service must also have customer service on par with your needs. You may have problems hosting your site, and hosting assistance must be able to help you (in my experience, Siteground also has amazing customer support).

## Step 7: Maintain

The launch of your website is not the end of the journey. Now it's time to monitor your users' behavior, and make changes to your website where necessary. **Update the content regularly**.

You’ve reached the end of this article! These are the 7 steps that I follow each and every time that I create a website. They are very important, and in my experience skipping some of these steps may lead to problems down the road. I hope you find my advice useful, and good luck with your web development endeavors!
